\chapter*{Abstract}

In order to find effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people worldwide, we need to identify subjects at risk of AD as early as possible. To this end, disease progression models have been recently developed, which not only to perform early diagnosis, but also estimate a unique disease signature that is used to predict the subjects' disease stages and future evolution. However, these models have not yet been applied to rare neurodegenerative diseases, are not suitable to understand the complex dynamics of biomarkers, work only on large multimodal datasets, and their predictive performance has not been objectively validated.

In this work I developed novel models of disease progression and applied them to estimate the progression of Alzheimer's disease and Posterior Cortical atrophy, a rare neurodegenerative syndrome causing visual deficits. My first contribution is a study on the progression of Posterior Cortical Atrophy, using models already developed: the Event-based Model (EBM) and the Differential Equation Model (DEM). My second contribution is the development of DIVE, a novel spatio-temporal model of disease progression that estimates fine-grained spatial patterns of pathology, potentially enabling us to understand complex disease mechanisms relating to pathology propagation along brain networks. My third contribution is the development of Disease Knowledge Transfer (DKT), a novel disease progression model that estimates the multimodal progression of rare neurodegenerative diseases from limited, unimodal datasets, by transferring information from larger, multimodal datasets of typical neurodegenerative diseases. My fourth contribution is the development of novel extensions for the EBM and the DEM, and the development of novel measures for performance evaluation of such models. My last contribution is the organization of the TADPOLE challenge, a competition which aims to identify algorithms and features that best predict the evolution of AD. 

\chapter*{Impact Statement}
\thispagestyle{empty}

The work presented in this thesis furthers our understanding of the temporal evolution of Posterior Cortical Atrophy and Alzheimer's disease. The disease progression models and evaluation techniques that we developed can help towards understanding underlying disease mechanisms, aid patient stratification and drug evaluation in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and Posterior Cortical Atrophy, and can be used in clinical practice for predicting the future evolution of subjects that are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. 

I published the work in this PhD thesis in two first-author papers (DIVE and TADPOLE chapters), and will soon submit another two papers (DKT and PCA chapters). I have also communicated my results in international conferences. I have also engaged with the broader scientific community by organising the TADPOLE Challenge, as well as a couple of hackathons at the PyConUK conference and the CMIC Summer School.

%Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with related dementias, is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects up to 44 million people worldwide.  All clinical trials have so far failed to find disease-modifying treatments -- it is believed that treatments are administered too late, and to wrong subjects that have different underlying pathology. We thus need to administer treatments as early as possible, and to the right subjects. 



\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\thispagestyle{empty}

%When I first started my PhD in October 2014, I attended a welcome lecture by Ivana Drobnjak who said that a PhD is a marathon and not a race. For me, it has actually been more of a triathlon. I've sometimes almost "drowned" in projects that didn't seem to lead to anywhere, while other times I've been cycling through tasks at great speed. 

There are many great people who have helped my PhD project become reality. First of all, I'd like to thank my supervisor Daniel Alexander, for his great advice, ideas and research directions. He has always encouraged me to pursue interesting ideas and supported me in developing them. Secondly, I'd also like to thank Alexandra Young and Neil Oxtoby for teaching me disease progression modelling, especially in the early years of my PhD. I'd also like to thank Sebastian Crutch, Tim Shakespeare, Keir Yong, and other DRC collaborators, for their help and advice on Posterior Cortical Atrophy and other clinical aspects of my work. I'd like to thank Marco Lorenzi, for trying to explain mathematics to a wanna-be mathematician like myself. Marco and Neil are also great guitar players, which I had the opportunity to hear a few times. I'd also like to thank Sara Garbarino, for her great spirit, for taking the time to repeatedly listen to my presentations when rehearsing them, and for reminding me that I was probably the biggest nerd in CMIC. I'd further like to thank the POND group, for the help they offered me throughout my PhD, for the great coffees we had after our meetings, and for reminding me that I can't deal with non-working technology in hotels during our trips in the Netherlands. I'd like to thank Gary Zhang for coaching me on how to present my work without putting half of the audience to sleep, as well as others in MIG and CMIC, for teaching me about diffusion MRI, machine learning and other imaging techniques. I remember coming to those meetings in early days of my PhD and not understanding what was being discussed.

In terms of the social aspect, I had a wonderful time at UCL. I'll miss the trips organised by Pawel Markiewicz around Wales and Cornwall, where we had a lot of fun surfing, playing frisbee and BBQ-ing on the beach. I'll also miss the great camping trips with the CMIC folks in Peak District and Lake district, when I attempted driving -- successfully! -- for the first time in the UK! I'll also miss the great time I had with Thore Bucking, Emma Hill and Kin Quan during the MRes year. I'll miss the dinners and lunches such as the EuroPOND celebratory lunch, when we got so excited that we each ordered 4 glasses of champagne, which got me tipsy. When we came back to UCL after lunch I realised I was actually breaking the code instead of doing anything useful.

Finally, I'd like to thank my parents, Aurora and Dan Marinescu, for their love and support, without which I wouldn't have been able to start the PhD in the first place. My brother Robert Marinescu, for his funny jokes and good spirit. My grandmother Anghelut\u{a} Constantina, for her funny and charismatic character. And my friends and housemates, in particular Vibhav Mishra, Carlos Gavidia and Mikael Brudfors, for the wonderful time spent in the Ifor residence, as well as Georgiana Ghetie, Alexandru Barbu and Oana Lang, for their light-hearted spirit, conversations and for the fun we had in the last few months of my PhD.
